# Future Plans for ghops

This document outlines planned features and enhancements for `ghops`, organized by priority and complexity.

## Short-term Goals (Next Release)

### PyPI Package Detection and Management

**Motivation**: Many Python repositories should be packages but aren't properly configured for PyPI distribution.

#### Package Detection (Code-First Approach)

- **Detect existing packages**: Scan repositories for `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, or `setup.cfg` files
- **Extract package metadata**: Parse packaging files to get the official PyPI package name
- **PyPI status check**: Query PyPI API to verify if the package exists and get version info
- **Add to status command**: Include `pypi_package` and `pypi_version` columns in status output
- **Summary statistics**: Track "repos with packages", "published packages", "outdated packages"

#### Auto-Package Generation

- **New command**: `ghops package init` to bootstrap packaging for repositories
- **Smart defaults**:
  - Package name from repository directory name
  - Version starts at `0.1.0`
  - Author/email from `git config`
  - Dependencies from `requirements.txt` if available
- **Template generation**: Create minimal but complete `pyproject.toml`
- **Interactive mode**: Prompt for key metadata when auto-detection isn't sufficient

#### Publishing Automation

- **New command**: `ghops package publish` to build and upload packages
- **Version management**: Integration with existing `bump-version` script
- **Batch operations**: Publish multiple packages with `--all` flag
- **Safety checks**: Warn before overwriting existing versions
- **Dry-run support**: Show what would be published without actually doing it

## Medium-term Goals

### Enhanced Repository Intelligence

#### Repository Classification

- **Language detection**: Identify primary programming language(s)
- **Project type inference**: Web app, CLI tool, library, documentation site, etc.
- **Framework detection**: React, Django, FastAPI, etc.
- **Dependency analysis**: Major dependencies and their versions

#### GitHub Features Integration

- **Issues tracking**: Show open/closed issue counts
- **Pull requests**: Track PR status and merge conflicts
- **GitHub Actions**: Monitor workflow status and failures
- **Releases**: Track latest release versions and changelog updates
- **Topics and labels**: Display repository categorization

#### Advanced Status Reporting

- **Security alerts**: Highlight repositories with security vulnerabilities
- **Dependency updates**: Show outdated dependencies across repositories
- **Code quality metrics**: Integration with tools like CodeClimate, SonarQube
- **Test coverage**: Display coverage percentages where available

### Workflow Automation

#### Smart Updates

- **Conditional updates**: Only pull when remote has changes
- **Dependency updates**: Automatically update package dependencies
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Run linters, formatters before commits
- **Branch management**: Create feature branches for automated updates

#### Batch Operations

- **Multi-repo search**: Find text/code patterns across all repositories
- **Bulk refactoring**: Apply changes across multiple repositories
- **Template synchronization**: Keep common files (like CI configs) in sync
- **License updates**: Bulk update license files and headers

## Long-term Vision

### Advanced GitHub Operations

#### Repository Management

- **Repository creation**: Create new repos with templates and best practices
- **Settings synchronization**: Standardize repository settings across projects
- **Team permissions**: Manage collaborator access across repositories
- **Branch protection**: Configure branch protection rules consistently

#### GitHub API Integration

- **Webhooks management**: Set up and manage repository webhooks
- **GitHub Apps**: Integration with GitHub Apps for enhanced permissions
- **Advanced search**: Use GitHub's search API for complex queries
- **Analytics**: Generate reports on repository activity and health

### Developer Experience Enhancements

#### Configuration Management

- **Profiles**: Different configurations for work, personal, client projects
- **Team sharing**: Share configurations and workflows with team members
- **Plugin system**: Allow community-contributed extensions
- **Custom templates**: User-defined templates for common project types

#### Integration Ecosystem

- **IDE integration**: VS Code extension, vim plugins
- **CI/CD integration**: Native support for popular CI/CD platforms
- **Project management**: Integration with Jira, Notion, Linear
- **Communication**: Slack/Discord notifications for repository events

### Performance and Scalability

#### Optimization

- **Parallel operations**: Concurrent repository processing
- **Incremental updates**: Only process changed repositories
- **Caching**: Smart caching of API responses and git status
- **Background processing**: Long-running operations in the background

#### Enterprise Features

- **GitHub Enterprise support**: Full compatibility with GitHub Enterprise Server
- **Large-scale deployments**: Handle hundreds or thousands of repositories
- **Audit logging**: Track all operations for compliance
- **Role-based access**: Different permissions for different team members

## Technical Improvements

### Architecture Enhancements

- **Plugin architecture**: Modular system for extending functionality
- **Configuration system**: More sophisticated config file management
- **Error handling**: Better error messages and recovery strategies
- **Logging**: Structured logging with different verbosity levels

### User Interface

- **Interactive mode**: TUI (Terminal User Interface) for complex operations
- **Web dashboard**: Optional web interface for team usage
- **Mobile companion**: Simple mobile app for monitoring repository health
- **Rich formatting**: Better use of colors, icons, and layouts in terminal output

## Community and Documentation

### Documentation

- **Video tutorials**: Screen recordings for complex workflows
- **Best practices guide**: Recommended patterns for different use cases
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and their solutions
- **API reference**: Complete documentation for all commands and options

### Community Building
